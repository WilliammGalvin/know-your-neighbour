    <h1>How to Help</h1>

    <p>
        As a community we can all help by supporting local organisations that aid our homeless neighbours. On a personal level, conversing and connecting with members of our community experiencing homelessness is a crucial step in connecting and strengthening our community. We can also help monetarily through donations to the local food bank, located at the Salvation Army, and donations to local shelters such as Out of the Cold, Home Horizons, and My Friendâ€™s House, to name a few. Volunteering your time at places like these, or creating your own initiatives is also a rewarding and positive way of making a difference in Collingwood. You can also help stop the spread of negative and untrue stereotypes surrounding homelessness, and instead spread awareness about the actual plight of homelessness in our world. For those who run local businesses, providing employment is incredibly important for helping our homeless neighbours. Advocating for policies and programs that address the root causes of homelessness, such as affordable housing, mental health and addiction services, and income support, is crucial for actual change. Additionally, attending and participating in local events or campaigns that raise awareness about homelessness and the need for solutions can also help make a difference in the community.
